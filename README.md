All Trophies Helper

This program will ultimately be used in order to help in All Trophies runs. In order to run the code as intended, download all files and run "Application.py" in the "All_Trophies_App" folder. Currently, only python files in "All_Trophies_Image_Recognition" are currently being used in the Application, but others have put a lot of work into helping with RNG manipulation, and it is all in that folder. I do not take credit for anything besides "ShortestPath.py" within that folder, but I decided to upload it here to be used in the future with the application. Currently, the program is fully implemented for use for checking bonuses using the implemented "bonus checker" as well as allowing users to manually input their collected bonuses, but the "bonus checker" is still inconsistent and usually misses around 10 bonuses if incorrect spots are chosen for the bonus checker. Finding an elegant solution to that will be my next challenge.

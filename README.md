# All Trophies Helper (WIP)

This program will ultimately be used in order to help in All Trophies runs. In order to run the code as intended, download all files and run "Application.py".

The current implementations in the program are as follows:
- A searchable list containing all the bonuses in the game
- A searchable list (2 methods) containing all of the 1P/Lotto trophies in the game
- Some resources provided at the top
- A "Bonus Checker" which looks at your screen and marks all the bonuses you have collected (WARNING: Only works on your main monitor and is still quite inefficient. I will be looking into better solutions, but for now, it is mediocre at best. It is also missing some associated pictures. If playing on emulator, turn off gamecube controllers briefly and use another controller/keyboard to scroll on the bonuses menu)
- RNG Manipulation for the Birdo trophy (must be done at the start of a run), 1P trophies on Adventure 1-1, the lotto at the start of the game, and the lotto at the end of the game

What are the future developments of this?
- Make the Bonus Checker more functional and more efficient
- Multithreading on initial lotto script
- Adding the rest of the resources at the top
- A "How to" guide on using the program
- Anything else that we feel is helpful for the speedrun
- Pretty up the program
